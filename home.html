    <center><h1>KELADI DYNASTY</h1></center> 
    <p class="discription">Nayakas of Keladi (1499–1763), also known as Nayakas of Bednore and Ikkeri Nayakas,
         were an Indian dynasty based in Keladi in present-day Shimoga district of Karnataka, India. 
         They were an important ruling dynasty in post-medieval Karnataka. They initially ruled as a vassal 
         of the famous Vijayanagar Empire. After the fall of the empire in 1565, they gained independence and
          ruled significant parts of Malnad region of the Western Ghats in present-day Karnataka, most areas in 
          the coastal regions of Karnataka, and parts of northern Kerala, Malabar and the central plains along the
           Tungabhadra river. In 1763 AD, with their defeat to Hyder Ali, they were absorbed into the Kingdom of Mysore.
            They played an important part in the history of Karnataka,[1] during a time of confusion and fragmentation that 
            generally prevailed in South India after the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Keladi rulers were of the 
            Vokkaliga[2] and Banajiga[2] castes and were Veerashaivas by faith.[3][4] The Haleri Kingdom that ruled over
             Coorg between 1600 A.D and 1834 A.D. was founded by a member of the Keladi family.
