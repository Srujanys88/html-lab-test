                The Shivappa Nayaka Palace named after the popular 17th-century king Shivappa Nayaka of the 
                Keladi Nayaka dynasty is located in Shivamogga city (formerly known as Shimoga), the district 
                headquarters of the Shivamogga district in Karnataka state, India. It is now the site of the 
                Government Museum.

                Though named after the Nayaka king, according to art historian George Michell, the palatial
                bungalow was actually built by the 18th century Mysore ruler Hyder Ali.[1] The building is
                a protected monument under the Karnataka state division of the Archaeological Survey of India.

                The two storied building comprises a Durbar hall ("nobel court") with massive 
                wooden pillars and lobed arched panels. The living chambers on the sides are at the 
                upper level and have balconies and look down into the hall.
